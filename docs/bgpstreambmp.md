We support `kafka` streams that are generated by the OpenBMP collector using the `BGPStream` tool. To configure this in the configuration file, use:

```
...
monitors:
  ...
  bgpstreamkafka:
    host: <YOUR_KAFKA_CONTAINER_HOST>
    port: <YOUR_KAFKA_PORT>
    topic: <YOUR_DESIRED_TOPIC>
  ...
...
```

As an example, to get CAIDA's **public** BMP feed:

```
...
monitors:
  ...
  bgpstreamkafka:
    host: bmp.bgpstream.caida.org
    port: 9092
    topic: '^openbmp\.router--.+\.peer-as--.+\.bmp_raw'
  ...
...
```

<!--
As of now there is an issue with the parsed timestamps from BGPStream so you need to define a custom environment variable.
